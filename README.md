<summary><h3>👨‍💻 Chris' Coding Journey</h3></summary>
I was not always the ones that developed interest from a young age, matter of fact, I was curious not interested. Part of me wanted to know how things get done in the tech world and so I got down to the basics, and from the moment I wrote my first code, I fell in love. I love to do a little bit of everything so I do switch to graphic design from time to time. I believe a sprinkle here and there of everything keeps the momentum going.
